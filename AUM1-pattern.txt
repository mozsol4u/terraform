Currently, AUM v1 follows the pattern below for patching and monitoring:

For each client, there are three subscriptions: NPD, PRD, and Shared. Under the Shared subscription, the following resources are created:

One Log Analytics workspace (Infra - for patching)
Two Log Analytics workspace CC & CE (Perf - for monitoring)
One Automation Account linked to the Infra Log Analytics workspace
Two DCR rules, one for CC and another for CE resources, linked to the Perf Log Analytics workspace
Alerts configured for CPU, Memory, disk, and VM availability
Based on RFC approval, jobs are created and run manually; there are no recurring jobs.
