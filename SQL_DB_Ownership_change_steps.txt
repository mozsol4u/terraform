# Step1: Make (John) the database owner

USE your_database_name;
ALTER AUTHORIZATION ON DATABASE::your_database_name TO john;

# Step2: Remove the old user (Smith) from the database

USE your_database_name;
EXEC sp_dropuser 'smith';

#Step3: If (Smith) is also a login at the server level, you can drop the login as well (This is an optional step OS user can be delete in local users)

DROP LOGIN smith;

# Step4: Ensure the (John) login has necessary permissions
USE your_database_name;

# Step5: Final Verification
SELECT name, SUSER_SNAME(owner_sid) AS owner
