# subscription-manager repos --enable satellite-maintenance-6.12-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
# satellite-maintain upgrade list-versions (This will show both 6.11 and 6.12) - If doesn't show the latest update we need to clean the repo
# yum repolist
# yum clean all
# satellite-maintain upgrade list-versions (If still not list might be a bug, we need to enable another repo)
# subscription-manager repos --enable satellite-6.12-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms (this time it deducts)
# satellite-maintain upgrade list-versions (it will show the available updates)
# satellite-maintain upgrade check --target-version 6.12 (To makesure everything is in good condition, all clean green here, if it fails for /etc/yum.conf )
# vi /etc/yum.conf
comment on line 7, where it says (exclude=python2-leapp,snactor,leapp-upgrade-el7toel8,leapp) and save the file
# satellite-maintain upgrade check --target-version 6.12 (it will display a warning message on leapp package, we can ignore at this time)
# satellite-maintain upgrade run --target-version 6.12 (the upgrade was successful, now we need to validate the new kernel)
# rpm --query --last kernel | head -n l
# uname --kernel-release
# hammer ping (it will show the relevant services status=ok, that means everything is running as expected without any issues)
