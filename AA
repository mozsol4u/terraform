Azure Automation Account Update Management - Overview
 
Azure Automation account update management is a dynamic feature that enables centralized patching and maintenance of Windows and Linux servers running in Azure. It provides an automated and scalable solution to keep your servers up to date with the latest security patches, ensuring the overall security and stability of your environment.

At XYZ an Automation Account is used for Windows server patching whereas Linux (RHEL) patching is managed through Red Hat Satellite server.

By leveraging Azure Automation account update management, XYZ can automate the patching and maintenance of Azure Windows servers which reduces manual effort and ensures consistent and timely updates across multiple subscriptions servers in the environment. In addition to this, it streamlines the management process, enhances security, and helps to maintain a healthy and up-to-date infrastructure.

Automation Account implementation

Creation: First, create an Automation account in Azure if one has not been created. The Automation account serves as a container for storing automation resources, including update management configurations and scripts.

Enable Update Management: Once the Automation account is created, enable the Update Management solution. This authorizes the Update Management feature within the Automation account and allows management of updates for Windows servers.

Configure update schedules: After enabling Update Management, configure the update schedules. You can define different update schedules based on your requirements (weekly, monthly, or custom). These schedules determine when updates are applied to Windows servers.

Configure update deployments: Update deployments define the target servers and update classifications that should be applied during the scheduled maintenance windows. You can choose to include or exclude specific server groups, or select the desired update classifications â€“ such as critical updates, security updates, or service packs.

Monitor update compliance: Azure Automation provides a dashboard that allows you to monitor the update compliance of Windows servers. We can view the compliance status and identify any servers that are missing updates or have failed installations. This helps to proactively identify and address any issues with the update process.

View update deployment reports: Azure Automation generates update deployment reports which provide detailed information about the status and results of update deployments. We can view these reports to gain insights into the success or failure of update installations and take necessary actions if any issues arise.


Customize update configurations: Azure Automation allows you to customize update configurations based on specific needs. It can define maintenance windows, reboot options, and configure pre- and post-script actions to be executed during the update process. This flexibility allows you to align the patching process with XYZ policies and requirements.

Integrate with Azure Monitor: Azure Automation account update management can be integrated with Azure Monitor to gain deeper insights into the patching and maintenance process. We can set up alerts and notifications based on specific criteria such as failed update installations or compliance deviations. This helps you stay informed about any critical issues and allows prompt remediation actions.
