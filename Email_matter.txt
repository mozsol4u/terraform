I hope this message finds you well. Firstly, I want to express our gratitude for your time today. As discussed in our meeting, we have implemented the changes we agreed upon, and you can find the updated spreadsheet attached to this email.

Please take a moment to review the document and fill in the columns highlighted in blue. Additionally, we would like to draw your attention to the fact that we have not considered patching for Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2, as extended security updates for these legacy operating systems are not available. For more detailed information, kindly refer to the Microsoft article provided below.

In order to facilitate your review process, we have added a new sheet labeled "Operating System List," which outlines various OS versions and their corresponding patching methods.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us before our follow-up call scheduled for next week. We highly value your input and want to ensure all aspects are thoroughly addressed.

To streamline our communication, could you please share your availability for a follow-up call on Monday, January 29th? Kindly specify a time that is convenient for your team, and we will promptly send you a meeting invitation accordingly.

Your cooperation and prompt attention to this matter are greatly appreciated. We look forward to your feedback and a productive follow-up discussion.
