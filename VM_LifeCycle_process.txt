This document provides guidelines on the lifecycle management of virtual machines in Azure and OCI cloud platforms. It is divided into two main sections.

 
1) Virtual Machine requirement
2) Decommisioning of a virtual machine

1) Virtual Machine:

Creating an Azure virtual machine (VM) in a cloud using the ServiceNow ticketing system involves few high-level steps that integrate IT service management (ITSM) with cloud resource provisioning. Here’s a streamlined process:

a) Service Request Submission

User Request: A user submits a request for a new Azure VM through the ServiceNow portal. The request form includes necessary details such as VM size, region, operating system, and any specific configurations.
Ticket Creation: ServiceNow generates a ticket for the VM request.


b) Approval Workflow
Manager Approval: The ticket is routed to the relevant manager or approver. They review the request for compliance with organizational policies and budget considerations.

Approval/Rejection: The manager approves or rejects the request. If approved, the process moves forward.

c) Automation Trigger
Automation Initiation: Upon approval, the Cloud Ops team will triggers an automation workflow. This can be done using Azure DevOps using Infrastrcuture as code (IaC) release pipeline workflow to respective subscription

d) VM Provisioning
This process uses the Infrastructure as Code (Iac) Bicep template to deploy the following resources:

- Resource Group Creation: If not already existing, a new resource group is created.
- Network Configuration: Necessary network components (virtual network, subnet, and network security groups) are configured.
- VM Deployment: The VM is created with the specified size, OS, and configuration.
- Post-Deployment Configuration: Additional configurations like attaching disks, setting up monitoring, Azure Backup, Enabling ASR (if needed), Azure Arc Agent deployment for (OCI VMs) and 
  applying security policies are completed

e) Configuration Management
CMDB Update: The Configuration Management Database (CMDB) in ServiceNow is updated with the new VM details, including resource ID, IP address, and other relevant metadata.

Tagging: The VM and associated resources are tagged for cost management, ownership, and compliance purposes and respective SME details.

f) Notification and Documentation
User Notification: The requester is notified via ServiceNow once the VM is ready for use.

Documentation: Detailed documentation of the VM, including access credentials and operational instructions, is provided to the user.

g) Ongoing Management
Monitoring and Alerts: The VM is monitored for performance and availability. Alerts and notifications are set up for any critical issues.
Backup and Disaster recovery: Enable Azure Backup and ASR if needed

Lifecycle Management: Periodic reviews are conducted to ensure the VM is still required and is being utilized efficiently.

h) Ticket Closure
Review and Close: The ticket is reviewed for completeness and then closed in the ServiceNow system once all tasks are confirmed to be completed successfully.

Decommisioning of Virtual machine

Decommissioning an Azure/OCI virtual machine using the ServiceNow ticketing system involves few high-level steps to ensure a controlled, audited, and secure process. Here’s an outline of the process:

a) Service Request Submission
User Request: A user or IT administrator submits a request to decommission an Azure VM through the ServiceNow portal. The request form includes details such as the VM's name, resource group, and justification for decommissioning.

Ticket Creation: ServiceNow generates a ticket for the decommissioning request.

b) Approval Workflow
Manager Approval: The ticket is routed to the relevant manager or approver. They review the request to ensure it aligns with organizational policies and that there are no dependencies on the VM.

Approval/Rejection: The manager approves or rejects the request. If approved, the process moves forward.

c) Pre-Decommissioning Checks
Dependency Verification: The IT team verifies that there are no critical dependencies on the VM (e.g., applications, services, or other resources that rely on the VM).

Data Backup: Ensure all necessary data is backed up from the VM if required. This may involve creating snapshots or exporting data to other storage solutions.

Notification: Inform stakeholders of the impending decommissioning to avoid any disruption to business operations.

d) Automation Trigger
Automation Initiation: Upon approval and completion of pre-decommissioning checks, the Azure DevOps Infrastructure as Code (IaC) will triggers an pipeline workflow.

e) VM Decommissioning
IaC Execution: The Bicep template is executed to decommission the VM.
VM Shutdown: The VM is shut down to ensure no data loss or corruption.
Data Deletion: Delete all associated data if not needed or move it to long-term storage if required.
Resource Deletion: The VM and all associated resources (disks, network interfaces, public IP addresses) are deleted from Azure.
Post-Deletion Actions: Any additional cleanup tasks, such as updating DNS records or removing the VM from monitoring systems, Azure Backups are completed.

f) Configuration Management
CMDB Update: The Configuration Management Database (CMDB) in ServiceNow is updated to reflect the decommissioning of the VM. All records related to the VM are marked as decommissioned or archived.

Tagging Update: Any tags related to the VM are updated to indicate its decommissioned status for cost management and audit purposes.

g) Notification and Documentation
User Notification: The requester and other relevant stakeholders are notified via ServiceNow once the VM has been successfully decommissioned.
Documentation: Detailed documentation of the decommissioning process, including steps taken and any data backups, is recorded for future reference and compliance.

h) Ongoing Management
Resource Review: Periodic reviews are conducted to ensure that all decommissioned resources have been properly removed and that no residual costs are incurred.
Audit and Compliance: Ensure that the decommissioning process complies with organizational policies and regulatory requirements. This may involve auditing logs and records of the decommissioning activities.

i) Ticket Closure
Review and Close: The ticket is reviewed for completeness, ensuring that all steps have been followed and that there are no outstanding issues. The ticket is then closed in the ServiceNow system.
