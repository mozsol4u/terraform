Final Notes:

A Quick Overview of OCI Subscriptions
There are two main subscriptions which manage the OCI workloads for patching and monitoring:

Core banking NPD
Core banking PRD
Both Windows and Linux servers are onboarded to these subscriptions through Azure Arc. The Azure Arc onboarding process for OCI workloads is fully automated. The following sequence of tasks runs:

Example:

Server Onboarding: If a server is migrated from on-premises or a new server is spun up in OCI, after joining the server to the Active Directory domain and moving it to the appropriate Organizational Unit (OU), the Arc Agent deployment GPO will handle the onboarding process for both NPD and PRD subscriptions.

Extension Deployment: Once the server is listed under Azure Arc, Azure Policy will push the following extensions:

For Windows: Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA), Azure Monitor Windows Agent (AMA), and Dependency Agent for Windows
For Linux: OMS Agent for Linux (MMA), Azure Monitor Linux Agent (AMA), and Dependency Agent for Linux
Patching Readiness: After the server is installed with the above extensions, it will automatically be added to Azure Update Management (Automation Account), registered under the Hybrid Worker Group, and listed under Machines, making it ready for patching.

Patching Tag Assignment: Each server is assigned the appropriate patching tag value.

Patching Naming Convention Format
The following is the format for the patching naming convention. It specifies how to interpret the patch_window tag values assigned to servers and All patching jobs must be scheduled using tags.

Example 1:

Name: patch_window
Value: NonProdA-W1
Explanation:
If a server has the tag value NonProdA-W1, it means that the server will be patched on NonProdA-W1 (Wave 1), which typically occurs on the 2nd Sunday following the 2nd Tuesday of the month. The patching maintenance window for this wave is on Sunday between 1am and 5am MT.

Example 2:

Name: patch_window
Value: NonProdB-W2
Explanation:
If a server has the tag value NonProdB-W2, it means that the server will be patched on NonProdB-W2 (Wave 2), which typically occurs on the 3rd Monday following the 2nd Tuesday of the month. The patching maintenance window for this wave is on Monday between 10am and 2pm MT.

Example 3:

Name: patch_window
Value: ProdA-W3
Explanation:
If a server has the tag value ProdA-W3, it means that the server will be patched on ProdA-W3 (Wave 3), which typically occurs on the 3rd Sunday following the 2nd Tuesday of the month. The patching maintenance window for this wave is on Sunday between 1am and 5am MT.

Summary
NonProdA-W1: 2nd Sunday following 2nd Tuesday, 1am - 5am MT.
NonProdB-W2: 3rd Monday following 2nd Tuesday, 10am - 2pm MT.

The following Azure policies have been enabled for OCI subscriptions:

[Policy Name 1]: [Description of what this policy enforces or ensures]
[Policy Name 2]: [Description of what this policy enforces or ensures]
[Policy Name 3]: [Description of what this policy enforces or ensures]
These policies ensure that OCI subscriptions adhere to the required compliance and security standards set by our organization.

Today, Cel leverages Azure Update Management (v1) for managing updates on both Azure and OCI clouds, handling the following workloads:

OCI
PP
Ev

We aim to migrate to Azure Update Management v2 by June 30th. Starting in July, this will allow us to patch both Azure and OCI, including all client workloads, using AUM v2. We plan to decommission AUM v1 in the second week of August.

The team has completed the proof of concept for AUM v2 and created a feature comparison matrix between v1 and v2.

RFC submission process and client communication

The team will submit RFCs each month on or before the 5th, allowing the CAB to review and approve them accordingly. CAB meetings occur every Monday and Thursday at 3 PM. For a normal RFC, it must be submitted 3 days in advance of the implementation date. If an RFC is not submitted with 3 days' notice, the approval will automatically escalate to management and the CTO.

Once the RFC is approved, the team typically sends a reminder email to the client or SMEs about the upcoming patching on Friday morning. On the patching day, after the patching is complete, the team sends an update email to inform about the patching status and closes the RFC on the same day.
