To create Windows server 2012 R2 in Azure using Image 

Pre-requsites
a) Make sure the subscription is enabled with the following quotas
   Standard D4s v3
   Standard B2as v2

Steps:

1)  Create a Virtual Machine in Azure with HyperV support

2)  Azure VM sizes that support nested virtualization include Dv3 and Ev3 series, in test lab created VM size Standard D4s v3 (4 vcpus, 16 GiB memory)

3)  Install Windows Server 2016 Datacenter 

4)  Login to the server

5)  Server manager, Add Hyper-v Role

6)  Download Windows 2012 R2 ISO (the media available on below link is evalution version 180 days)

    Reference URL: 
    https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2012-r2   

7)  Open HyperV, create a virtual machine "Test01", Select Generation=1, Disk= Fixed, define the OS disk size=Example 40GB

8)  Assign 2 processors, 8 GB memory

9)  Assign administrator credentials

10) Login to the HyperV hosted Windows server 2012R2

11) Install Azure guest agent, validated OS essential services, makesure change the Windows Firewall settings (Allow Remote Desktop connection to Public, File & Print ICMP allow, Remote 
    Desktop Allow connection and make sure NLA is deselected, reboot few times to ensure everything works as expected

12) Shutdown the HyperV hosted Windows server 2012R2

14) Create Service principal with client seceret in Entra ID under App registration, This is temprorily for moving the VHD file into storage account, and ensure contributor permissions 
    assign

13) Download StarWind V2V converter utility

    Reference URL: 
    https://www.starwindsoftware.com/starwind-v2v-converter

14) Follow the below steps to convert the VHDX to VHD and uploaded the VHD file into Azure storage

    Reference URL:

15) During the conversion process, it will create a Storage account under the subscrption where you are targeting this VHD to be move

16) Process will finished with an Error message displays "Error sending to Azure, operation could not be completed as a result conversion failed" ignore this alert and click on Finish

17) Login to Azure, Navigate the Storage Account under container, there is a blob container created inside you will find a VHD file

18) Now we need to create a Image using this blob container VHD file

19) On the Azure portal, search for Images

20) Create Image, provide details such as (Subscription, Resource group, name, Generation) 

    Note: For Legacy Operating System (2008R2, 2012R2) make sure the Generation of the VM=1

21) Click on Finish to create the Image

22) Now we need to create a Azure virtual machine using the Image

23) Azure portal, search Virtual Machines

24) Create a Virtual machine

25) provide details such as (Subscription, Resource group, VM name) 

     Security type= Standard
     Image= Click on configure VM generation, change the generation from V2 to V1
     Click on See all images
     Click on My Images
     Select the Image name

26) Follow the Wizard and click Finish

27) Creating a Virtual machine using fixed VHD might takes some time between 30 minutes to an hour, It depend on size of the VHD

Observations:

- You'll see the deployment message as "Failed" just ignore it and try to RDP into it, The machine will accept the logon credential which has been setup during Hyperv setup.
- The complete shutdown may takes time and always agent not running message appears in the machine blade
