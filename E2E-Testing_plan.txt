Overview:

1) We need to create 2 merge startup scripts under appianadmin home directory name as below

 - merge-start.sh (under this script file, we have to define the paths of appian startup script commands)
 - merge-stop.sh (under this script file, we have to define the paths of appian stop script commands)

1st Step
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

vi /home/application/merge-start.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Change to the directory where the first custom script is located
cd /home/application/data/apa

# Run the command that requires elevated privileges to execute the first custom script
sudo ./start.sh -p Welcome

# Sleep for 2 minutes (120 seconds)
sleep 120

# Change to the directory where the second custom script is located
cd /home/application

# Run the command that requires elevated privileges to execute the second custom script
sudo ./start2.sh

# Sleep for 2 minutes (120 seconds)
sleep 120

# Change to the directory where the thrid custom script is located
cd /home/application/data/bin

# Run the command that requires elevated privileges to execute the third custom script
sudo ./start3.sh

# Sleep for 2 minutes (120 seconds)
sleep 120

# Change to the directory where the fourth custom script is located
cd /home/application/data/bin

# Run the command that requires elevated privileges to execute the fourth custom script
sudo ./start4.sh

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2nd Step
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

vi /home/application/merge-stop.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Change to the directory where the first custom script is located
cd /home/application/data/apa

# Run the command that requires elevated privileges to execute the first custom script
sudo ./stop.sh

# Sleep for 2 minutes (120 seconds)
sleep 120

# Change to the directory where the second custom script is located
cd /home/application

# Run the command that requires elevated privileges to execute the second custom script
sudo ./stop2.sh

# Sleep for 2 minutes (120 seconds)
sleep 120

# Change to the directory where the thrid custom script is located
cd /home/application/data/bin

# Run the command that requires elevated privileges to execute the third custom script
sudo ./stop3.sh

# Sleep for 2 minutes (120 seconds)
sleep 120

# Change to the directory where the fourth custom script is located
cd /home/application/data/bin

# Run the command that requires elevated privileges to execute the fourth custom script
sudo ./stop4.sh

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
3rd Step
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Run the below command for executable permission 
chmod +x merge-start.sh
chmod +x merge-stop.sh


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
4th Step - start the main script by manual method
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Run both scripts manually before creating a cronjob

# cd /home/applicatition
# ./merge-start.sh

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
5th Step - Check the Application launching page - If successful
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
6th Step - stop the main script by manual method
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

# cd /home/applicatition
# ./merge-stop.sh

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
7th Step - Check the Application launching page - shouldn't be accessible
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
8th Step - If the manual start/stop scripts successful - create cronjob
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To configure the cronjob follow the below steps

#crontab -u application -e

25 08 * * 1-5 /home/wasadm/merge-start.sh
45 08 * * 1-5 /home/wasadm/merge-stop.sh

To check if the crontab has configured under application user profile

#crontab -u application -l

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

9th Step - If everything works perfectly - then we need to enable Automation Runbook configuration for Server (Start/Stop)
using cronjob dependency
